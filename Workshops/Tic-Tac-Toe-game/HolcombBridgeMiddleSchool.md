# The Game

* Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game normally played on paper where 2 players take turns and try to get 3 in a row to win
* Everyone has played it
* Everyone knows the rules
* It's an easy way to learn some programming basics
* It's also fun to make it more sophisticated, like 7 by 7 boards where you must get 5 in a row to win!
* And, it's a fun thing to play against your friends over the internet or using mobile phones or tablets

# The Code

We have code samples of the game implemented with varying levels of sophistication

## Sample 1: Simple game that doesn't even keep score (Keep score yourself, no better than a sheet of paper!)

## Sample 2: Score-keeping and powerful JavaScript code from a famous company

This second example uses more powerful code techniques, including using a  
JavaScript library called AngularJS created by the software developers who work at Google.
AngularJS is a free and "open source" library that makes building interactive web pages, mobile apps, and games
easier.

This version also keeps score!

## Sample 3: Game Time

The last example is even more powerful. It keeps score, but it also lets you:

* Change the board and winning streak length, like to 7 by 7 and 5 to win
* Chat with your peers as play
* See a scoreboard that displays results as games finish
* What do YOU want us to build next?

It uses AngularJS still, as well as an HTML and CSS templating framework called Bootstrap, created by people who work for Twitter.com. It also uses code from several other
companies, including:

* PubNub.com -- Provides "real-time" communication between different web browsers connected to the same site
* MongoLab.com -- An online database for storing documents in JavaScript Object Notation format (JSON)
* Underscore.js -- "functional" library for JavaScript
