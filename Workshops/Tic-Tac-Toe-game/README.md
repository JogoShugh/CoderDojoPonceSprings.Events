# Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

For building the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you don't need to download any software if you don't want to. We typically use the online tool [Plnkr.co](http://plnkr.co) to do the workshop.

However, if you'd rather download a text editor, we recommend [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

### What youâ€™ll learn

Learn how to use foundational Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) tags and Cascasing Style Sheets (CSS) while
creating a simple and fun Tic-Tac-Toe game that you can play against your friends.
