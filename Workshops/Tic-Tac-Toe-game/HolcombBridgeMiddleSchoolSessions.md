# Holcomb Bridge Middle School CoderDojo Founding Sessions

## Session 1: Tuesday, November 12th

### Goal: Learn more about HTML with Codecademy at **http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web**.

### Recap

This first session introduced you to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. There's much more to learn 
about these, and a great place to start reinforcing your understanding is to go through the free online lessons at Codecademy, starting with their **Web Fundamentals** course. That course will help you prepare for our third session,
where you'll combine it with what you learn in the second session to make new features in your Tic Tac Toe game.

### Other materials we used in the first session

* [CoderDojo Tic Tac Toe game and starter templates](https://github.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/Events/blob/master/Workshops/Tic-Tac-Toe-game/HolcombBridgeMiddleSchool.md)
* Multi-player Tic-Chat-Toe version ](http://jogoshugh.github.io/CoderDojoPonceSprings.TicTacToe/vNext/)

## Session 2: Tuesday, November 19th

### Goal: Learn JavaScript basics with Codecademy at **http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript**.

### Preview

Since most of you are new to the subjects of programming and web development, we will use this session to start learning 
the JavaScript programming language.

During the last 15 minutes of the session, we'll all play the Tic Tac Toe games some more, and come up ideas for new features or to build, as a group, during the 3rd session.

### Homework after Session 2

To get ready to build your ideas into the game, make sure you've gone through and understand the two tutorials mentioned above:

* **Web Fundamentals: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web** -- Builds upon the intro materials from the first session
* **Introduction to JavaScript: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript** -- The tutorial we did in session 2

## Session 3: Tuesday, December 3rd

### Goal: Build new features in your game!

### Preview

During this session, we'll form teams of two or three and implement new features in the Tic Tac Toe game 
using the skills you gained by doing the Web and JavaScript tutorials from Codecademy.

We will also tell you more about how to get involved with the larger CoderDojo community in Alpharetta or in 
Atlanta by getting started at http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings.
