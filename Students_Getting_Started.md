All of these resources are **free**!

help with.** Even if you're not new, completing the resources below at home will strengthen your skills!

# Beginning Web Site Development

Want to learn about building web pages? It's best if you start on your own, and then come in with questions we can help you with. 

* Start with this [Build a Web Page All About You](http://www.codecademy.com/goals/web-beginner-en-3pc6w) tutorial. We'll help you fix bugs and add new stuff.
* If you complete that, start on the [Web Fundamentals course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) to learn more.

# Beginning Web Programming with JavaScript

Want to learn about writing programs that create animation or scripts that can make your web page more fun and interactive?

* To learn animation and drawing, start with [Khan Academy's Programming track](https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/programming).

* To learn about web scripting and JavaScript, start with [Codecademy's JavaScript course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).

* Mastered those? Try [animating the solar system in this tutorial](http://www.codecademy.com/goals/web-beginner-en-ymqg0)! 

# Beginning Python Programming

[Codecademy Python tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)

# For all the above tracks

Once you've done the Codecademy lessons, try to find some fun projects and more materials from Learnstreet:

[Learnstreet projects for JavaScript, Python, and more](http://www.learnstreet.com/cg/simple/projects/)

# CoderDojo Kata Wiki

You can also try the official CoderDojo Kata wiki, but sometimes those resources are not updated as often as they should be:

[CoderDojo Coding Kata](http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Main_Page)

# For Intermediate and Advanced Students:

We know many of you have been through the materials above and others. You can keep going, or:

* You can bring the work you've already started at previous sessions, or
* Come with ideas of new things you want to learn
* Mentors will be available to help you go further or get started on new things

# Resources developed by CoderDojo Ponce Springs mentors!

Some of the mentors in our dojo have been developing resources of their own for you.

We're working on organizing the materials better for you, but you can find them all linked from the README.md files 
inside the folders corresponding to previous events here: [CoderDojoPonceSprings.Events](https://github.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/Events)

# And even more resources!

Code.org keeps a good "jumping off" point for online learning [right here](http://www.code.org/learn/codehs).
You are not limited to learning these languages in our dojo! It's just that, so far, this is what most students 
have expressed interest in, and what most mentors have experience with. If you have other goals and ideas, just 
let us know and we'll do our best to help you get started or take what you've already done even further.

And, if you find other great online resources, let us know!
