# CoderDojo Ponce Springs 7/27/2013 Event Outline and Resources

Thanks for attending CoderDojo Ponce Springs -- a free and fun place where Atlanta's kids learn how to code, 
supported by mentors and parents! We hope you have a great time.

# Key Times

* 1:00 PM: Volunteers begin setting up

# Info for Parents

## Getting here and parking

See [PARKING.md](../PARKING.md) for info on getting here and where to park -- **and where to avoid parking**!

## What to bring

* Bring a laptop for your child. We don't have any loaner laptops this time.
* We'll have soft drinks and water and a some snacks, but if you'd like to bring some other snacks to share, 
that would be great.

# Info for Students

## Special Reminder

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a **playground**. Ultimately, you get to decide 
what programming languages, tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. 
And, all of us: mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can always ask a mentor about things that 
interest you, or any other questions you have.

We even have a special **Any Question Any Time** area where you can come to ask questions that might be 
totally different from what is happening in the workshop areas. Or, you can come there with your laptop and 
just work on whatever you want to and get help from mentors or other students.

## When you arrive

We'll have have multiple work areas, some set up as workshops broken down for different student skill 
levels, and another one called **Any Question Any Time** for you to talk with mentors about anything you want.

## What's your current experience with coding?

If you want to start with one of the workshops, see where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further

# Workshop Sessions Summaries

Each session will begin around 2:15, so pick one of these by then. You don't have to stick with the same 
session the whole time, and we'll be repeating them at least for a few more sessions.

* For **beginner level** students:

  * **Workshop A-1:** Create a fun Tic-Tac-Toe game and learn HTML and CSS basics
  
  `or`
  
  * **Workshop A-2:** Build your own web site and expand your HTML and CSS skills
  
  `or`

  * **Workshop B-1:** Create fun animations and geometric shapes with Python
  
  `or`

  * **Workshop B-2:** Recieve an introduction to the Scratch programming language created by MIT.  Documentation on what the introduction will cover [can be found here](https://github.com/versionone/CoderDojo-ScratchDemo/blob/master/README.md).

* For **intermediate level** students:

  * **Workshop C:** Build the classic arcade game Pong in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  
  `or`

  * **Workshop D:** Make battling JavaScript robots!

## Any Question Any Time area

* If you have other questions or goals that don't fit into any of the workshops, or who are at an **advanced level**
, come over to the **Any Question Any Time**. You can ask any question you want to mentors or other students, and you
can even bring your laptop and just hang out and work on your own projects. It's up to you.

**Note:** *We'll continue to offer the same sessions for a while, and you can always drop in and out of a session 
any time you like.*

# Any Question Any Time area

* Are you interested in learning something that we don't yet have a workshop about?
* Or, have you been building something on your own or with friends that you'd like some help with?
* Or, are you mostly interested in subjects that you're not sure how coding might fit in with?

If you're been writing code for a while and already have projects you're working on and goals for 
problems you're trying to solve, we want to hear about it! We'll do our best to help you or find you
the help you need!

You can even help us set the goals for future workshops and events!

## Resources for learning more on your own or with friends
