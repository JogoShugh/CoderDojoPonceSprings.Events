# Info for Parents

## Getting here and parking

See [PARKING.md](../PARKING.md) for info on getting here and where to park -- **and where to avoid parking**!

## What to bring

* Bring a laptop for your child. We don't have any loaner laptops this time.
* We'll have soft drinks and water and a some snacks, but if you'd like to bring some other snacks to share, 
that would be great.

# Info for Students

## Special Reminder

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a **playground**. Ultimately, you get to decide 
what programming languages, tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. 
And, all of us: mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can always ask a mentor about things that 
interest you, or any other questions you have.

We even have a special **Any Question Any Time** area where you can come to ask questions that might be 
totally different from what is happening in the workshop areas. Or, you can come there with your laptop and 
just work on whatever you want to and get help from mentors or other students.

## When you arrive

We'll have have multiple work areas, some set up as workshops broken down for different student skill 
levels, and another one called **Any Question Any Time** for you to talk with mentors about anything you want.

## What's your current experience with coding?

If you want to start with one of the workshops, see where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further

# Workshop Sessions Summaries

Each session will begin around 2:15, so pick one of these by then. You don't have to stick with the same 
session the whole time, and we'll be repeating them at least for a few more sessions.

* For **beginner level** students:

  * **Workshop A-1:** Create a fun Tic-Tac-Toe game and learn HTML and CSS basics
  
  `or`
  
  * **Workshop A-2:** Build your own web site and expand your HTML and CSS skills
  
  `or`

  * **Workshop B-1:** Create fun animations and geometric shapes with Python
  
* For **intermediate level** students:

  * **Workshop D:** Make battling JavaScript robots!

## Any Question Any Time area

* If you have other questions or goals that don't fit into any of the workshops, or who are at an **advanced level**
, come over to the **Any Question Any Time**. You can ask any question you want to mentors or other students, and you
can even bring your laptop and just hang out and work on your own projects. It's up to you.

**Note:** *We'll continue to offer the same sessions for a while, and you can always drop in and out of a session 
any time you like.*

## Workshop B-1: Code animations and geometry with Python

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

For this workshop you will need Python installed on your computer.  We will be using the latest version of Python, which is 3.3.2.  However, if you already happened to have an older version of Python installed on your computer, it will work just fine.

* **Windows**
  * Download and install Python for Windows at http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/python-2.7.5.msi
* **Mac**
  * If you have a Mac, it already has Python pre-installed.  Just download and install the IDLE development environment from here: http://www.python.org/getit/mac/tcltk/.  You will need to choose the "Recommended" download for your OSX version.

### What you’ll learn

Use the popular and fun Python programming language to animate a turtle and learn key programming and Python concepts like for loops, ranges, and defining functions to create reusable code libraries to share with friends.

### Resources for going further after this tutorial

Now that you know the basics, you’re ready to become an expert. Here are some resources for going deeper:

* Learn Python online through an interactive step-by-step tutorial (without any download) at http://www.learnpython.org/
* Feeling like a challenge? Try http://learnpythonthehardway.org/! Just kidding, it's actually quite an easy way to learn Python, a really good way to start if you're new to programming.
* Tons of more learning resources for Python here: http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers
* The documentation for the `turtle` module that we will be using can be found here: http://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

## Workshop D: Make battling JavaScript robots!

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

No installation required. We’ll be using the free site http://fightcodegame.com/. This site requires that you have
an account with [http://www.github.com](http://www.github.com) first. GitHub requires that you be at least 
13-years-old, so if you're younger, make sure your parents approve or create the account for you.

You can study the documentation here: http://fightcodegame.com/docs/.

### What you’ll learn

Create virtual robots that battle each other head to head and rack up points while learning more about 
programming JavaScript with functions, object-orientation and inheritance, events, and more.
  
For True Intermediates, they can start coding, experimenting, and battling basic robots. For Those newer to 
coding, we will discuss design problems, and their code solutions:

* Movement Tutorial - focus creating a wall crawler (simple math calculations and angles)
* Friendly fire - using cloning and NOT shooting friendly robots
* Defense - Using 'Disappear' in a smart way to escape from an enemy
   
### Resources for going further after this tutorial

Fighting robots are popular in other languages too, but so are real, physical robots. Here are some resources:

* Robocode: develop robot battle tanks to fight each other: http://robocode.sourceforge.net/ (This is what FightCodeGame.com is based on)
* Lego Mindstorms: write code to make *real* robots move and do all kinds of things: http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx
* Arduino is an open-source electronics platform intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects and environments: http://www.arduino.cc/ 

# Any Question Any Time area

* Are you interested in learning something that we don't yet have a workshop about?
* Or, have you been building something on your own or with friends that you'd like some help with?
* Or, are you mostly interested in subjects that you're not sure how coding might fit in with?

If you're been writing code for a while and already have projects you're working on and goals for 
problems you're trying to solve, we want to hear about it! We'll do our best to help you or find you
the help you need!

You can even help us set the goals for future workshops and events!

## Resources for learning more on your own or with friends
