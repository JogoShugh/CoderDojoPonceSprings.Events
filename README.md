# CoderDojo Ponce Springs Events 

Thanks for attending CoderDojo Ponce Springs -- **_a free and fun place where Atlanta's kids learn how to code, 
supported by mentors and parents!_** We hope you have a great time.

# Parents

**Remember to bring a laptop for your student.** We have some machines that you can borrow during the event, but they are all Linux based, and not everyone is familiar with Linux.

## Volunteers, Mentors

If you're volunteering for the first time, we need you to [complete the application and background check authorization by going to this page](http://coderdojoponcesprings.azurewebsites.net/app/index.html#/).

## Parking Tips

Definitely see our [parking guide](https://github.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/Events/blob/master/PARKING.md). 

## Students

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a **playground**. Ultimately, you get to decide 
what programming languages, tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. 

And, all of us: mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

### What interests you most?

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can always ask a mentor about things that 
interest you, or any other questions you have.

### What's your current experience with coding?

Think about where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further.

# This Event

We are founded on the [CoderDojo.com principles](Promise.md). Our events are broken into two halves, in order to support beginners as well as returning students working our ongoing series tracks!
