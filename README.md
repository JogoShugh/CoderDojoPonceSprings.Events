## Quick links and RSVP info for Parents, Mentors and other Volunteers

### All: Directions and parking Tips

Be sure to read our [parking guide](https://github.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/Events/blob/master/PARKING.md)!

### Parents: Homework to do with your kids before coming and what to bring to the event:

* **Please remember to bring a laptop for your student.** We have some machines that you can borrow during the event, but they are all Linux based, and not everyone is familiar with Linux. iPads or other tablets are not ideal for our events.
* _We recommend you do one of the beginner videos [**linked below in the Learning resources**](#learning-resources) section together with your students_. However, let the student control the keyboard as much as possible. For inspiration, see [Sugata Mitra's Child-Driven Education TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education).

#### How to RSVP

## Sneak preview

Curious what an event looks like?

## Student tips

Students, remember that the dojo is a partly a ["flipped classroom"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching), but mostly a **playground**. 

This means you should start **coding at home before you attend events**, starting with the resources linked below. Come to the event having tried something already. We'll help you go further and have fun with what you're learning!

### What interests you most?

We want you to feel free to pursue whatever programming languages, tools, and ideas are most interesting to **you**. You can always ask a mentor about things that you want to get into or to demo things you've tried at home.

### What's your current experience with coding?

Think about where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further.

## Learning resources

If you are a beginner, or you want to begin something new, then the best thing to do is start trying it at home on your own laptop. **Try out any of the following free resources at home**, and then bring your laptop and show us and other students what you're learning. 

We'll help you keep going from beginner to expert!

### Video courses

Like learning from videos you can stop and rewind? Try one of these:

* [Basic HTML for Kids](http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=teaching-kids-basic-html) (1 hour video course)
* [Learn to program with C# and Turtles](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/teaching-kids-programming) (1h)
* [Learn to program with Scratch](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/learning-programming-scratch) (5h)
* [Learn to Program Android apps with App Inventor](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/android-beginner-app-inventor) (2.5h)
* [Learn to Program PC and X-Box Games with Kodu Kingdom Defense](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/learn-to-program-kodu-kingdom-defense) (3h)

### Written tutorials

Not into video training? We've got a huge list of other ways to get started on our [Students Getting Started and Online Learning Guide](Students_Getting_Started.md).

## Free interactive courseware from Teaching Kids Programming

Want to get even more in-depth? You can download the courseware and training from [Teaching Kids Programming](http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/). It's really impressive and fun!

If you have any issues or questions, please email **coderdojo AT versionone DOT com**

## Mentor recruitment

As mentioned above we have two ongoing mentor-led tracks, for Minecraft plugin development with Java, and HTML5 game development with Quintus. We are actively recruiting mentors for new series tracks! We don't require that you build their own materials. There is plenty of material to use already!

We need mentors to help students pursue the following:

* [Making Android Apps with App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) -- It's as easy as Scratch, but for Android apps!
* [Explore Electronics with Arduino](http://exploringarduino.com/) --  The microcontroller platform that helps you learn about electrical engineering, programming, and human-computer interaction
* [Sphero: The App-Controlled, Programmable Robot Ball That Does it All](http://www.gosphero.com/) -- Sphero is an amazing robot orb that can move, jump, and even swim. We have 4 Spheros, you won't need to buy one unless you want to donate another! [See this video](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_MBVZScuhukM0pBTGZzbnU3Vlk/edit?pli=1) of kids from [Mental Fitness ATL](http://www.mentalfitnessatl.org/) going nuts with Sphero!
* 3D Modeling for Minecraft and Beyond: Using Autodesk's Free 3D Modeling Tools for CoderDojos -- Autodesk is providing free [3D modeling tools to all CoderDojos](http://coderdojo.com/news/2014/07/15/autodesk-provide-all-dojos-free-3d-modelling-tools)! The tools can even be used to make models to import into Minecraft!
