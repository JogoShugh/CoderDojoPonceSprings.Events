# Info for Students

## Special Reminder

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a **playground**. Ultimately, you get to decide 
what programming languages, tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. 
And, all of us: mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can always ask a mentor about things that 
interest you, or any other questions you have.

## What to do before coming to Coder Dojo, and in between sessions

Please see our **[Students getting started and online learning guide](https://github.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/Events/blob/master/Students_Getting_Started.md)**. In it, you'll find lots of great free resources that you should study and practice with in your own time on the following learning tracks:

* Beginning HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Intermediate HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript with Fighting Robots
* Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript with Learnstreet.com Projects
* Beginning Python
* Intermediate to Advanced Python with Learnstreet.com Projects
* Beginning Scratch

You should start on one or more of these tracks so that you'll have good questions and ideas for what you'd like to learn more about when you visit the dojo in person. 

### Highly recommended

_We highly encourage you to utilize the free lessons and projects on **Codecademy** and **Learnstreet**, and other online resources._


## When you arrive

You'll find multiple work areas, most set up as workshops broken down for different skill 
levels. See next:

## What's your current experience with coding?

Think about where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further.

# Have fun and learn a lot! Let us know how we're doing too :-D

We want you to have fun and learn lots of new things! We also love your feedback and want to know what kinds of ideas you have and what you want to learn, so let us know when you visit! Thanks!
