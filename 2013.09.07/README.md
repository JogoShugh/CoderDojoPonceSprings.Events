# Workshops outline

First, read the [Events Intro document](../EVENTS_INTRO.md) for the overall agenda, directions, and background info about of our events.

**Students:** be sure to check out the [Students getting started and online learning guide](https://github.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/Events/blob/master/Students_Getting_Started.md), because you'll probably want to do some of the lessons and tutorials listed there before you attend our Coder Dojo. It will make it more fun for you to do your homework! We promise!
