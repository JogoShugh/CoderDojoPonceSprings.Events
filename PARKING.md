# Parking for CoderDojo Ponce Springs

We have two dojo locations:

# 1. Midtown Atlanta office in the Ponce Springs Lofts building

## Finding Us
* We're in the bottom floor of the Ponce Springs building at 620 Glen Iris Drive Suite 1B, at the corner of Glen Iris 
and North Avenue, near Ponce City Market (gigantic old City Hall East / Sears building) and directly across the
street from Dancing Goats Coffee. 
* We're adjacent to the Gecko Sushi restaurant

## Visitor Parking

* **Visitor parking in the Ponce Springs Lofts parking deck can be limited!** The deck is behind the building, left 
of the gated entrance for the condo community. The first two floors have visitor spaces.

## Parking Alternatives

* Alternatively, you may be able to find a spot at the **Pinnacle Credit Union 
just up the hill at 536 North Avenue** toward Kennesaw Avenue on the right side 
(towards downtown; opposite direction of Ponce City Market & Dancing Goats Coffee)
 * The credit union is closed on Saturday and the parking lot usually has about 40 empty spaces -- I don't know if 
this officially approved, but others have parked there before with no problem
* There are other side streets off of Glen Iris and North Avenue that you can try also

## Parking Warnings!

* Please do not park in the numbered spots adjacent to our building, the ones with warning signs on them. People
who park here get towed :(
* **I don't advise you to park in Dancing Goats lot**, as it is private. The security for Ponce Springs Market is 
very strict about this, and we do not have official approval for visitors to park there.
 * However, if you purchase a coffee or something from Dancing Goats, then you are their customer for the day.

# 2. Alpharetta VersionOne headquarters

Occassionally we have events in Alpharetta. Parking there is super easy.

The address is 6220 Shiloh Road Suite 400. Atlanta, GA 30005. It is off McFarland Road, which is exit 12 on 400. If driving north on 400, then turn right. If coming south, turn left. The turn to Shiloh road is just past the parking area for the Big Creek Greenway trail -- a nice place to walk after a dojo, no doubt.

Dojo events are held on the bottom floor, so you can park around the back of the building and enter through the doors on the bottom. We're in the same building as the Taco Mac office. Unfortunately, there is no Taco Mac restaurant there though.
