# The CoderDojo Promise (from CoderDojo.com)

## Open Free Learning!

## The CoderDojo Principles:

* Our context is open, free, child-led, learning.
* We are open source.
* Child safety comes before everything except common sense.
* Participation is always free of charge.
* Playing and creating lead our learning and we share what we learn.
* What works in an individual CoderDojo is shared, not enforced.
* We collaborate and rely on each other.
* Champions, mentors, parents and their kids are responsible for each other.
